# Spopify SQL EDA Project

This project involves performing Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) on a Spotify dataset using PostgreSQL and pgAdmin. The dataset contains various audio and streaming features for tracks, including artist information, album types, song characteristics (danceability, energy, tempo, etc.), and engagement metrics such as views, likes, comments, and streams.

Through this analysis, I have also derived insights relevant to business analysis, including patterns in user engagement, platform-specific performance, and streaming behavior across different content types.
